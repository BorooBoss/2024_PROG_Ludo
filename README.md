# Console Game Ludo with Graphical User Interface
Ludo is a classic board game that is played by two to four players. Each player has four tokens of the same color, which they aim to move around the board based on dice rolls. 
The objective is to get all four tokens from the starting area to the home column before the other players. Players take turns rolling the dice, and if they land on an opponent's token, 
they can send it back to the starting area. The game is a mix of strategy and luck, as players must decide the best moves while hoping for favorable dice rolls. More on details and rules in `PROG1_projekt2023`.

## Console version
To introduce the plot, this was my final project in first semester but unfortunatelly I was not able to finish it mainly because of lack of experience. I left the project with customizable game board and fully 
working version for one player. One year later I decided to finish this project using Object-oriented programming. The code was very raw, far from perfect. Some things I changed because I had to, but some 
I decided to leave as they were because of small changes in outcome with a lot of time spent.      
The finished console version is called `clovece-console_v2.py`. It was done according to the assignment except there is possibilty to play with 3 or 4 players not only 2. Every console print looks similar to the example 
with updated postions of players.

## Tkinter version
As soon as I finished this project I worked with idea if it is possible to draw board in python library **Tkinter**. With some drawing functions and changes in main loop it was really possible. 
Here are the results from `clovece_tkinter_final.py`
